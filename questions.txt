My name is Gabi Saint

I made an empty folder with my name, but it did not show up on GitHub.

I think Git ignores empty folders unless they have files inside.

I moved questions.txt into my name folder and then the folder appeared on GitHub. 
Now there is only one copy of questions.txt, inside my folder. 
I think this happened because GitHub only shows folders if they have files in them.

When I deleted questions.txt, Git still remembered it until I used "git rm" 
and pushed again. Then it was gone from GitHub. 
I learned that deleting in Git needs the Git workflow too.
